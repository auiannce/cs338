- Proposal: We would like to make a deep dive video into the Ashley Madison Breach. We plan to go over what the Ashley Madison website was, the timeline of the hack, the technical details (how were passwords and information about the clients stored on the website), and the social impact of the breach (laws that were made and public reaction). We also plan to talk about ways the company could had prevented this attack and also ways users could had protected their information better. 
- Timeline of Video:
  - Introduction (~ 2 minutes) :
    - Background/ context
    - Motivation for attack
    - Timeline of the attack
  - Hypothetical Attack Scenarios with plausible technical details (5-7 minutes)(to the best of our ability):
    - What is the structure of the security of the company (how can you attack the company)
    - Could an outsider do the attack? If so, how?
    - Could an insider do the attack? If so, how?
  - Impact of the Attack (~ 2 minutes):
    - Laws that were made
    - People who were affected by the hack (stakeholders)
    - Financial impact
  - Protection(~3 - 5 minutes):
    - How companies can protect themselves (where could the attack fail)
    - How users could protect themselves (where could attack fail)
